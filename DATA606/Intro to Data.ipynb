    "### 1.7 Fisher’s irises\n",
    "\n",
    "Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher was an English statistician, evolutionary biologist,\n",
    "and geneticist who worked on a data set that contained sepal length and width, and petal length\n",
    "and width from three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor and virginica). There were 50 flowers\n",
    "from each species in the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) How many cases were included in the data?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) How many numerical variables are included in the data? Indicate what they are, and if they are continuous or discrete.\n",

    "### 1.9 Air pollution and birth outcomes, scope of inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1.3 introduces a study where researchers collected data to examine the relationship between air pollutants and preterm births in Southern California. During the study air pollution levels were measured by air quality monitoring stations. Length of gestation data were collected on 143,196 births between the years 1989 and 1993, and air pollution exposure during gestation was calculated for each birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.23 Haters are gonna hate, study confirms\n",
    "\n",
    "A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology asked a group of 200 randomly sampled men and women to evaluate how they felt about various subjects, such as camping, health care, architecture, taxidermy, crossword puzzles, and Japan in order to measure their dispositional attitude towards mostly independent stimuli. Then, they presented the participants with information about a new product: a microwave oven. This microwave oven does not exist, but the participants didn’t know this, and were given three positive and three negative fake reviews. People who reacted positively to the subjects on the dispositional attitude measurement also tended to react positively to the microwave oven, and those who reacted negatively also tended to react negatively to it. Researchers concluded that “some people tend to like things, whereas others tend to dislike things, and a more thorough\n",
    "understanding of this tendency will lead to a more thorough understanding of the psychology of\n",
    "attitudes.”\n",

    "### 1.33 Light, noise, and exam performance\n",
    "\n",
    "A study is designed to test the e↵ect of light level and noise level on exam performance of students. The researcher believes that light and noise levels might have di↵erent e↵ects on males and females, so wants to make sure both are equally represented in each treatment. The light treatments considered are fluorescent overhead lighting, yellow overhead lighting, no overhead lighting (only desk lamps). The noise treatments considered are no noise, construction noise, and human chatter noise.\n",

    "### 1.55 Distributions and appropriate statistics, Part I\n",
    "For each of the following, statevwhether you expect the distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed. Also specify whether the mean or median would best represent a typical observation in the data, and whether the variability of observations would be best represented using the standard deviation or IQR.

    "### 1.69 Side effects of Avandia\n",
    "\n",
    "Rosiglitazone is the active ingredient in the controversial type 2 diabetes medicine Avandia and has been linked to an increased risk of serious cardiovascular problems such as stroke, heart failure, and death. A common alternative treatment is pioglitazone, the active ingredient in a diabetes medicine called Actos. In a nationwide retrospective observational study of 227,571 Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 years or older, it was found that 2,593 of the 67,593 patients using rosiglitazone and 5,386 of the 159,978 using pioglitazone had serious cardiovascular problems. These data are summarized in the contingency table below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiovascular problems\n",
    "Yes No Total\n",
    "Treatment Rosiglitazone 2,593 65,000 67,593\n",
    "Pioglitazone 5,386 154,592 159,978\n",
    "Total 7,979 219,592 227,571\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Determine if each of the following statements is true or false. If false, explain why. Be careful:  The reasoning may be wrong even if the statement’s conclusion is correct. In such cases, the statement should be considered false.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. Since more patients on pioglitazone had cardiovascular problems (5,386 vs. 2,593), we can conclude that the rate of cardiovascular problems for those on a pioglitazone treatment is higher.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. The data suggest that diabetic patients who are taking rosiglitazone are more likely to have cardiovascular problems since the rate of incidence was (2,593 / 67,593 = 0.038) 3.8% for patients on this treatment, while it was only (5,386 / 159,978 = 0.034) 3.4% for patients on pioglitazone.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. The fact that the rate of incidence is higher for the rosiglitazone group proves that rosiglitazone causes serious cardiovascular problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "iv. Based on the information provided so far, we cannot tell if the difference between the rates of incidences is due to a relationship between the two variables or due to chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) What proportion of all patients had cardiovascular problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) If the type of treatment and having cardiovascular problems were independent, about how many patients in the rosiglitazone group would we expect to have had cardiovascular problems?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) We can investigate the relationship between outcome and treatment in this study using a randomization technique. While in reality we would carry out the simulations required for randomization using statistical software, suppose we actually simulate using index cards. In order to simulate from the independence model, which states that the outcomes were independent of the treatment, we write whether or not each patient had a cardiovascular problem on cards, shuffled all the cards together, then deal them into two groups of size 67,593 and 159,978. We repeat this simulation 1,000 times and each time record the number of people in the rosiglitazone group who had cardiovascular problems. Use the relative frequency histogram of these counts to answer (i)-(iii).\n",
    "\n",
    "i. What are the claims being tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Compared to the number calculated in part (b), which would provide more support for the alternative hypothesis, more or fewer patients with cardiovascular problems in the rosiglitazone group?\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. What do the simulation results suggest about the relationship between taking rosiglitazone and having cardiovascular problems in diabetic patients?\n",

    "\n",
    "A survey was conducted to study the smoking habits of UK residents. Below is a data matrix displaying a portion of the data collected in this survey. Note that “£” stands for British Pounds Sterling, “cig” stands for cigarettes, and “N/A” refers to a missing component of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What does each row of the data matrix represent?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) How many participants were included in the survey?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Indicate whether each variable in the study is numerical or categorical. If numerical, identify\n",
    "as continuous or discrete. If categorical, indicate if the variable is ordinal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.10 Cheaters, scope of inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Exercise 1.5 introduces a study where researchers studying the relationship between honesty, age, and self-control conducted an experiment on 160 children between the ages of 5 and 15. The researchers asked each child to toss a fair coin in private and to record the outcome (white or black) on a paper sheet, and said they would only reward children who report white. Half the students were explicitly told not to cheat and the others were not given any explicit instructions. Di↵erences were observed in the cheating rates in the instruction and no instruction groups, as well as some di↵erences across children’s characteristics within each group.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Identify the population of interest and the sample in this study.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be generalized to the population, and if the findings of the study can be used to establish causal relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.28 Reading the paper\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are excerpts from two articles published in the NY Times:\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) An article titled Risks: Smokers Found More Prone to Dementia states the following: \n",
    "\n",
    "“Researchers analyzed data from 23,123 health plan members who participated in a voluntary exam and health behavior survey from 1978 to 1985, when they were 50-60 years old. 23 years later, about 25% of the group had dementia, including 1,136 with Alzheimer’s disease and 416 with vascular dementia. After adjusting for other factors, the researchers concluded that pack-a-day smokers were 37% more likely than nonsmokers to develop dementia, and the risks went up with increased smoking; 44% for one to two packs a day; and twice the risk for more than two packs.”\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on this study, can we conclude that smoking causes dementia later in life? Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Another article titled The School Bully Is Sleepy states the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "“The University of Michigan study, collected survey data from parents on each child’s sleep habits and asked both parents and teachers to assess behavioral concerns. About a third of the students studied were identified by parents or teachers as having problems with disruptive behavior or bullying. The researchers found that children who had behavioral issues and those who were identified as bullies were twice as likely to have shown symptoms of sleep disorders.”\n",
    "\n",
    "A friend of yours who read the article says, “The study shows that sleep disorders lead to bullying in school children.” Is this statement justified? If not, how best can you describe the conclusion that can be drawn from this study?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.36 Exercise and mental health\n",
    "\n",
    "A researcher is interested in the effects of exercise onvmental health and he proposes the following study: Use stratified random sampling to ensure representative proportions of 18-30, 31-40 and 41- 55 year olds from the population. Next, randomly assign half the subjects from each age group to exercise twice a week, and instruct the rest not to exercise. Conduct a mental health exam at the beginning and at the end of the study, and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) What type of study is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) What are the treatment and control groups in this study?\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) Does this study make use of blocking? If so, what is the blocking variable?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) Does this study make use of blinding?\n",
    "\n",
    "(e) Comment on whether or not the results of the study can be used to establish a causal relationship between exercise and mental health, and indicate whether or not the conclusions can be generalized to the population at large.\n",
    "\n",
    "(f) Suppose you are given the task of determining if this proposed study should get funding.  Would you have any reservations about the study proposal?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.48  Stats scores\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are the final exam scores of twenty introductory statistics students.\n",
    "57, 66, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 77, 78, 78, 79, 79, 81, 81, 82, 83, 83, 88, 89, 94\n",
    "\n",
    "Create a box plot of the distribution of these scores. The five number summary provided below may be useful.\n",

    "Min Q1 Q2 (Median) Q3 Max\n",
    "57 72.5 78.5 82.5 94\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.50 Mix-and-match\n",
    "\n",
    "Describe the distribution in the histograms below and match them to the box plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.56 Distributions and appropriate statistics, Part II\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of the following, state whether you expect the distribution to be symmetric, right skewed, or left skewed. Also specify whether the mean or median would best represent a typical observation in the data, and whether the variability of observations would be best represented using the standard deviation or IQR. Explain your reasoning. \n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Housing prices in a country where 25% of the houses cost below $350,000, 50% of the houses cost below $450,000, 75% of the houses cost below $1,000,000 and there are a meaningful number of houses that cost more than $6,000,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) Housing prices in a country where 25% of the houses cost below $300,000, 50% of the houses cost below $600,000, 75% of the houses cost below $900,000 and very few houses that cost more than $1,200,000.\n",

    "### 1.70 Heart transplants\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stanford University Heart Transplant Study was conducted to determine whether an experimental heart transplant program increased lifespan. Each patient entering the program was designated an experimental heart transplant candidate, meaning that he was gravely ill and would most likely benefit from a new heart. Some patients got a transplant and some did not. The variable transplant indicates which group the patients were in; patients in the treatment group got a transplant and those in the control group did not. Another variable called survived was used to indicate whether or not the patient was alive at the end of the study. Of the 34 patients in the control group, 30 died. Of the 69 people in the treatment group, 45 died.\n",
    "\n",
    "(a) Based on the mosaic plot, is survival independent of whether or not the patient got a transplant? Explain your reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "(b) What do the box plots below suggest about the efficaacy (effectiveness) of the heart transplant treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "(c) What proportion of patients in the treatment group and what proportion of patients in the control group died?\n",
    "\n",
    "(d) One approach for investigating whether or not the treatment is e↵ective is to use a randomization technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "i. What are the claims being tested?\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. The paragraph below describes the set up for such approach, if we were to do it withut using statistical software. Fill in the blanks with a number or phrase, whichever is appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We write alive on cards representing patients who were alive at the end of the study, and dead on cards representing patients who were not. Then, we shuffle these cards and split them into two groups:\n",
    "one group of size representing treatment, and another group of size representing control. We calculate the difference between the proportion of dead cards in the treatment and control groups (treatment - control) and record this value. We repeat this 100 times to build a distribution centered at . Lastly, we calculate the fraction of simulations where the simulated differences in proportions are . If this fraction is low, we conclude that it is unlikely to have observed such an outcome by chance and that the null hypothesis should be rejected in favor of the alternative.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. What do the simulation results shown below suggest about the effectiveness of the transplant program?"
